In Julia, this is achieved using BigFloat, which uses the C library MPFR under the hood. By default, it uses 256 bits of precision. This allows more accurate computations, but rounding error will still accumulate and for big enough inputs or long enough computations a significant loss of accuracy may still occur.\ninterval arithmetic: Use intervals instead of numbers and perform all operations so that the resulting interval contains the true result.
