# DedekindCutArithmetic.jl

A Julia library for exact real arithmetic using [Dedekind cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut) and [Abstract Stone Duality](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=02c685856371aac16ce81bf7467ffc4d533d48ff). Heavily inspired by the [Marshall](https://github.com/andrejbauer/marshall) programming language.

## üíæ Installation

1. If you haven't already, install Julia. The easiest way is to install [Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#installation). This allows to easily install and manage Julia versions.

2. Open the terminal and start a Julia session by typing `julia`.

3. Install the library by typing

    ```julia
    using Pkg; Pkg.add("DedekindCutArithmetic")
    ```

4. The package can now be loaded (in the interactive REPL or in a script file) with the command

    ```julia
    using DedekindCutArithmetic
    ```

5. That's it, have fun!

## üå± Quickstart example

The following snippet shows how to define the square root of a number and the maximum of a function $f: [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ using Dedekind cuts. It also shows this definition is actually computable and can be used to give a tight rigorous bound on the value.

```julia
using DedekindCutArithmetic

# Textbook example of dedekind cuts, define square-root
my_sqrt(a) = @cut x ‚àà ‚Ñù, (x < 0) ‚à® (x * x < a), (x > 0) ‚àß (x * x > a)

# lazy computation, however it is automatically evaluated to 53 bits of precision if printed in the REPL.
sqrt2 = my_sqrt(2);

# evaluate to 80 bits precision, this gives an interval with width <2‚Åª‚Å∏‚Å∞ containing ‚àö2
refine!(sqrt2; precision=80)
# [1.4142135623730949, 1.4142135623730951]

# Define maximum of a function f: [0, 1] ‚Üí ‚Ñù as a Dedekind cut
my_max(f::Function) = @cut a ‚àà ‚Ñù, ‚àÉ(x ‚àà [0, 1] : f(x) > a), ‚àÄ(x ‚àà [0, 1] : f(x) < a)

f = x -> x * (1 - x)

fmax = my_max(f);

refine!(fmax) # evaluate to 53 bits of precision by default
# [0.24999999999999992, 0.25000000000000006]
```
