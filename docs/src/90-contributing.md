This page has some tips and guidelines on how to contribute.

We welcome all kinds of contribution, including, but not limited to code, documentation, examples, bug reports, feature requests etc.

All interactions should folow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/lucaferranti/DedekindCutArithmetic.jl/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). In a nutshell, be polite and respectful.

!!! tip
    Feel free to ping us after a few days if there are no responses.

## Discussions

If you need help using `DedekindCutArithmetic.jl`, you can use the [helpdesk](https://github.com/lucaferranti/DedekindCutArithmetic.jl/discussions/categories/helpdesk) category to ask for help. This is preferable over issues, which are meant for bugs and feature requests, because discussions do not get closed once fixed and remain browsable for others.

There is also a [show and tell](https://github.com/lucaferranti/DedekindCutArithmetic.jl/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) category to share with the world your work using DedekindCutArithmetic.jl. If your work involves a new application of `DedekindCutArithmetic.jl` and you also want it featured in the Applications section in the documentation, let us know. You will get help with the workflow and setup, but you are expected to do the writing ðŸ˜ƒ .

## Opening issues

If you think you found a bug, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/lucaferranti/DedekindCutArithmetic.jl/issues). Issues to suggest new features are welcome too.

## Opening pull requests

We follow the [ColPrac guide for collaborative practices](https://github.com/SciML/ColPrac). New contributors should make sure to read that guide before opening their first pull request.

If you found an issue that interests you, comment on that issue what your plans are.
If the solution to the issue is clear, you can immediately create a pull request.
Otherwise, say what yourfollow proposed solution is and wait for a discussion around it.

For small changes (typos, trivial bug fixes) it is ok to open a PR directly even without an associated issue. For non-trivial changes, please open an issue first.

More technical details and tips on how work with git, run tests, build documentation etc. can be found in the [developer's guide](91-developer.md).
